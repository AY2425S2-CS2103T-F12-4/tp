## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/MockUI.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com jb/Crypto Minor bd/2000-01-01 wa/2014-12-12` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete [employee id prefix]` : Deletes the specified employee contact. _Note: Employee ID prefix has to pinpoint only one Employee for delete to work._

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

<br>**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

---
### Viewing help: `help`

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

![help message](images/HelpU.png)

Format: `help`
---
### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL jp/JOB [t/TAG]… bd/DATE wa/DATE​`

Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
bd/ stands for birthday and wa/ stands for work anniversary.

Both are optional.

Both of which are standard anniversaries that the app will make for you
with just the date!
Other anniversaries can be added as well with `Add Anniversary` command below.
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com jp/President bd/2001-01-01 wa/2020-07-08`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com jp/Cleaner p/1234567 t/criminal bd/2005-12-01 wa/2025-05-21`
---
### Listing all persons: `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book.

Format: `list`
---
### Editing a person: `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit [Employee ID prefix] [n/NAME] [eid/EMPLOYEE_ID] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [jp/JOB] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the specified employee. The Employee ID can be shortened down and not necessarily needed to type in the full ID. The Employee ID prefix **must be Unique.**
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.
* You can change the employee id by typing edit [Employee ID prefix] eid/[new Employee ID]

Examples:
*  `edit 1re p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the specified employee to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2dsf n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the specified employee to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.
*  `edit 1sdg21 eid/3b9417cc-cf4e-4231-bc4d-4fd167c2abc6` Edits the employee id to be now `3b9417cc-cf4e-4231-bc4d-4fd167c2abc6` so long as no such employee id already exists.
---
### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds employees whose names or/and job positions contain any of the given keywords.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can use this format in 3 ways!
</div>

Format 1 (Searching for name): `find n/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Format 2 (Searching for job positions): `find jp/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

Format 3 (Searching for both name and job positions): `find n/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] jp/KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* [For **Job Positions**] Only full words will be matched e.g. `Mana` will not match `Manager`
* [For **Name**] Partial words can be matched e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the find command:**<br>

* When you search within a single field (like n/ for name or jp/ for job position), you only need one of the keywords to match — it's an OR search.

  * For example: find `n/Hans Bo` will find anyone with "Hans" or "Bo" in their name, like `Hans Gruber` or `Bo Yang`.

* When you use multiple fields together, the command finds people who match all of them — it becomes an AND search.

  * For example: `find n/Hans jp/engineer` finds people whose name includes "Hans" and whose job position includes "engineer".

* In the case of multiple fields and keywords, you will only see a person on the list if they match at least one keyword from each field.

  * So `find n/Hans Bo jp/dev manager` finds people whose name contains "Hans" or "Bo", and whose job position has the word "dev" or "manager".
</div>

Examples:
* `find n/li` returns `David Li` and `Real Li`
* `find n/david Li` returns `David Li` and `Real Li`
* `find n/li ri jp/ dev manager` returns `David Li`, `Real Ri` and `Real Li`<br>

![result for 'find n/li ri jp/ dev manager'](images/FindLiRiDevManagerResult.png)
### Deleting a person: `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete [Employee ID prefix]`

* Deletes the person of the specified Employee ID.
* The command only works if the Employee ID is unique.
* The Employee ID **must be valid and unique**

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete [Employee ID prefix]` deletes the specified employee.

# Anniversary Commands

# **Add Anniversaries `AddAnniversaryCommand`**

The `AddAnniversaryCommand` adds a new anniversary to an existing employee record in the address book.
This command can create custom Anniversaries that were otherwise not supported within the AddPerson Command.

<summary>Quirks & Edge Cases</summary>

**1. Employee ID Prefix Ambiguity**
- If the prefix matches multiple employees, an error displays.
- If the prefix does not match any employees, an error displays.

**2. Duplicate Anniversary Detection**
- The command checks existing anniversaries for the same date, name, description, and type.

**3. Multiple Type Descriptors**
- `atdesc/` can be repeated multiple times.

**4. Prefix Order**
- Required prefixes must appear: `eid/`, `d/`, `an/`, `at/`.

**5. Date Formatting**
- Must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

**6. Description Field**
- `ad/` is optional.

**7. Successful Addition**
- A success message is displayed upon completion.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Common Errors & Messages</summary>

- **Multiple employees found with prefix**
    - Provide a longer Employee ID prefix.

- **Employee ID prefix not found**
    - Check for typos or confirm the employee exists.

- **Anniversary already exists**
    - Change at least one detail to avoid duplicates.

- **Invalid Command Format**
    - Ensure all required prefixes are present.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tips</summary>

- **Use Unique Descriptions**: Helps differentiate otherwise similar anniversaries.
- **Check Date Validity**: Watch out for invalid or non-existent dates (e.g., leap years).

## **Show anniversaries:** `showAnni`

Shows the list of anniversary details of the person specified by the Employee ID.

Format: `showAnni eid/Empoyee_ID`

* Displays a new window with a list of anniversaries of the person specified by the Employee ID
* Details like dates, description and name will be displayed as well.
* Beginners can use the button in the GUI to do the same thing.
* The employee ID refers to the ID of the person in the address book, that you have specified when adding or generated if you did not.

Examples:
* showAnni eid/e22e5292-0353-49a9-9281-5a76e53bc94f

---
## Delete Anniversaries: `deleteAnni`

order within the Employee's list of anniversaries.
If successful, the chosen anniversary will no longer appear in that employee’s list of anniversaries.


## **Command Format**
```plaintext 
deleteAnniversary eid/EMPLOYEE_ID ad/INDEX
```
## **Parameters**

| **Prefix** | **Meaning**                                                   | **Required?** | **Example**  |

## **Example Usage**
```plaintext
deleteAnniversary eid/0c2414da ad/1
```


<details>
<summary>Quirks & Edge Cases</summary>

- **Employee ID Prefix Ambiguity**  
  If multiple employees share the same prefix, an error is thrown, prompting you to use a longer or full ID.

- **Employee Not Found**  
  If no employee matches the given prefix, an error is displayed.

- **Index Out of Bounds**  
  If the given index is greater than the number of anniversaries in the record, an error is displayed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Common Errors & Messages</summary>

- **Multiple employees found with prefix**  
  Provide a longer or more specific ID prefix.

- **Employee ID prefix not found**  
  Check for typos or confirm that the employee exists.

- **Anniversary index out of bounds**  
  The index must be within the valid range of the employee’s anniversary list.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tips</summary>

- **Confirm the Anniversary Index**  
  Because the code internally uses zero-based indexing, but the user command typically uses one-based indexing, verify that you’re specifying the correct anniversary number.

- **Disambiguate Employee IDs**  
  If you suspect multiple employees share a prefix, provide a longer portion of the ID.
</details>

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

---
### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

---
### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

---
### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

 **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.


---
## **ImportCommand** `import`
Use the `import` command to bring external data (in CSV or JSON) into your current address book. Depending on the write mode (`append` or `overwrite`), you can either merge the new data with your existing records or replace them entirely.

## **Command Format**
```plaintext
import ft/FILE_TYPE fp/FILE_PATH fn/FILE_NAME wm/WRITE_MODE
```


## **Parameters**

| **Prefix** | **Meaning**                                       | **Required?**                          | **Example Value**           |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `ft/`      | File type to import (`json` or `csv`)             | **Required**                           | `json` / `csv`             |
| `fp/`      | Optional base directory or file path              | At least one of `fp/` or `fn/` required| `./data` / `C:\Users\John\`|
| `fn/`      | Optional filename (extension can be auto-added)   | At least one of `fp/` or `fn/` required| `myData.json`               |
| `wm/`      | Write mode (`append` or `overwrite`)              | **Required**                           | `append` / `overwrite`      |

## **Example Usage**
```plaintext 
import ft/json fp/data/ fn/contacts wm/append
```

<details>
<summary>Quirks & Edge Cases</summary>

1. **File Type Validation**
    - Supported only `json` or `csv`.

2. **File Path & Filename Usage**
    - You can provide a complete file path with extension via `fp/`.
    - If you also supply `fn/`, ensure `fp/` is just a directory (or the import will fail).

3. **Write Mode**
    - `append` merges new records but skips conflicts.
    - `overwrite` clears existing data entirely before importing.

4. **Extension Enforcement**
    - If you use `fn/` without an extension, the system may automatically append `.json` or `.csv` based on `ft/`.
    - Mismatched extensions will raise an error.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Common Errors & Messages</summary>

- **`Invalid file type`**  
  Provide either `json` or `csv` in `ft/`.

- **`Write mode must be specified as either 'append' or 'overwrite'`**  
  Ensure `wm/` is one of the two valid modes.

- **`Provide either a full file path or a filename, not both`**  
  This occurs if you pass `fp/` that includes a filename and also use `fn/`.

- **`Filename must be provided if path is just a directory`**  
  If `fp/` is a directory, you must specify a filename (`fn/`).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tips</summary>

- **Check Extension Conflicts**: If your file says `.json` but you specify `ft/csv`, it will fail.
- **Ensure Proper Permissions**: The path must be writable or readable for the import to succeed.
- **Use Overwrite Cautiously**: This mode replaces all current data, so confirm backups if needed.
</details>

---
## **ExportCommand** `export`
Use the `export` command to save the currently visible list of people in the address book to a file (JSON or CSV). If you provide a specific directory path (`fp/`), the system will export the file there. If you also include a file name (`fn/`), any missing extension is automatically appended based on the file type.

## **Command Format**
```plaintext
export ft/FILE_TYPE [fp/FILE_PATH] [fn/FILE_NAME]
```

## **Parameters**

| **Prefix** | **Meaning**                                     | **Required?**              | **Example Value**     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| `ft/`      | The file type to export (`json` or `csv`)       | **Required**               | `json` or `csv`       |
| `fp/`      | The optional file path (directory or full path) | Optional if `fn/` is used | `./output/`           |
| `fn/`      | The optional filename (extension auto-added)    | Optional if `fp/` is used | `contacts`, `data.csv`|

## **Example Usage**
```plaintext
export ft/json fp/data/ fn/contacts
```


<details>
<summary>Quirks & Edge Cases</summary>

1. **File Type Restrictions**
    - You must specify either `json` or `csv` using `ft/`.

2. **Empty Records**
    - If the current list of displayed people is empty, export fails with an error.

3. **File Path & Filename**
    - Provide either just a path (e.g., `fp/output/`) and let the system use a default file name, or specify both a path and a filename.
    - If you specify a full file path including a filename, do not also use `fn/`.

4. **Auto-Extension**
    - If you use `fn/contacts` but `ft/json`, the resulting file is `contacts.json`.

5. **Error Handling**
    - Mismatched file types or inaccessible directories (e.g., read/write issues) will cause an error.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Common Errors & Messages</summary>

- **`Invalid filetype`**  
  Occurs if you use something other than `json` or `csv` with `ft/`.

- **`No people to export`**  
  Raised if no records are currently displayed for export.

- **`Provide either a full file path or a filename, not both`**  
  If `fp/` already includes a filename and `fn/` is also used.

- **`Error exporting data`**  
  If an IOException or other issue happens during file creation.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tips</summary>

- **Confirm the Output Path**: If none is provided, a default location may be used.
- **Check the Exported File**: Verify the correct file extension and contents.
- **Filtering**: Only exports the currently visible list of people, so use commands like `filter` or `search` beforehand.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
